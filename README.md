# GMM_Trial
A repo for practising the basics of 3D Geometric Morphometric analysis using Geomorph, including reading in, GPA, PCA, and linear modelling.

This is purely for practising some basics for members of Vera Weisbeckers lab and has no guarantees regarding updates. Feel free to use as a starter and drop [Vera](vera.weisbecker@flinders.edu.au) a line if you do.
